   <h2>Hiii and Halo!!!</h2>
     <p>I'm Weiyan Wu, a junior computer science student at Cornell University. I am a computer lover, space lover, and aerospace pursuer. I am always curious about problem solving, and fascinated with game design, software development, and data analysis. I like designing game during spare time using JavaScript and watching Harry Potter. I am a chatty girl so whatever topic just bring them to me. Feel free to contact me via ww333@cornell.edu.</p>
     <p><strong>Objective now:</strong> Actively looking for an internship or research opportunities summer2022!</p>
