  <h2>Ludo Game Based on OCAML, Cornell University</h2>
  <h3>Software Engineer Feb. 2021-Jun. 2021</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Led 3 engineers to designed and implemented a strategy board game Ludo in OCAML (a functional programming language) with over 4,000 lines of code and published the game online at <a href="https://ludo-front-end.vercel.app/">here</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Added timing, artificial intelligence(AI), and graphical user interface features to achieve Human-Versus-AI mode.
  </li>
  <li>Investigated over 50 potential players and created a game-based tutorial based on their feedbacks to make the Ludo game more friendly to first-time players with 2,000 lines individually implemented code.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Platform Games & 7-Days Game Design, Cornell University</h2>
  <h3>Individual Game Designer Jan. 2021-Present</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Created a 2D 7-Days Puzzle Game in Unity using C# and implemented three platform games using HTML,
    JavaScript, and CSS which can be played on local host web server with keyboard.
  </li>
  <li>
    Added zoom, navigation, and dialogue features in 7-Days Game to allow interaction.
  </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Exploratory Data Analysis of Airplane Delays in the US, Cornell University</h2>
  <h3>Analyst Feb. 2021-May 2021</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Built models in Python to investigate a dataset of 5,000,000 flight delays and cancellations during 2015 in the US.
  </li>
  <li>
    Predicted future airplane delays with A/B testing, exponential smoothing, seasonality, and other machine learning techniques, which resulted in a prediction of more than 90% accuracy.
  </li>
  <li>Published advice for passengers regarding choosing flights through intuitive visualizations by SQLiteStudio and Tableau, and demonstrated the correlation between airplane delays and factors such as weather, departure time, etc</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Virtual RISC-V Based On C++, Tsinghua University</h2>
  <h3>Software Engineer Sep. 2020-Jan. 2021</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>
    Led a four engineer team to implemented a virtual RISC-V processor with C++ to approximate the Eulerâ€™s number and process other complicated mathematical calculations, and posted it at <a href="https://github.com/BladLust/ERISC">here</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Visualized the operating process with 500 lines of code by exporting binary images and a self-made movie.
  </li>
  </ul>
